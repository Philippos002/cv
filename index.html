                        Hello, I am Filip! I am 20 years old and, at the moment, I am student.
                        In the near future, I want to be a full stack web developer. I am the
                        family guy, and I hope that I'll have a lot of children. One day, I will
                        marry Ivana, my girlfriend, which will be their mother. I have a little
                        brother Novak, and he is the person who I love with all of my heart.
                        I hope that they, along with my family, will stay with me forever.
                        I love you!
                    </p></td>

        <h3>My education</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My first touch with education was actually not in school. 
            My mother was my first ever teacher. She teached me how to read and how to 
            write. I was full able to read when I was only 3 years old! An amazing 
            achievement, isn't it?</li>
            <li>My primary school was a school in my village, <a href="http://www.osilribar.edu.rs/">"Ivo Lola Ribar"</a>.
            I hated my grade, my teacher and most of my professors. Why? Uhm, because
            they didn't deserve better. Short and clear.</li>
            <li>After that, I went to a school in city - <a href="https://www.tehnickasd.edu.rs/">Tehnicka skola</a> in Smederevo.
            New area, new friends, everything new. But there, I met a couple of good guys, in 
            the difference of primary school. I finished it and now, I am Computer technician.</li> 
            <li>But, not for much longer. When I finish my Faculty, I will be Engineer
            of Information Systems and Technologies. Wish me luck!</li>
        </ul>
